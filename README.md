# üèê AVP Video Tracking

**AVP Video Tracking** is a Python-based application designed to track volleyball players on the court during gameplay. Inspired by the groundbreaking work being done by **BallTime AI**, this project leverages machine learning libraries and computer vision to analyze and visualize players' positions in real time.

## What It Does
AVP Video Tracking processes video footage of a volleyball game to detect and track players' movements on the court. The application uses YOLOv8 to identify players and analyze their positioning during gameplay.

Key features include:
- **Player Detection:** Identifies players within the video and tracks their movements.
- **Court Tracking:** Determines whether players are on the near or far side of the volleyball court.
- **Mini-Court Visualization:** Mirrors player positions on a smaller, simplified court for visual analysis.

## How to Use It

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zpasha/AVP-Video-Tracking.git
    cd AVP-Video-Tracking
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
